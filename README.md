# Grama Darpan â€“ Transparent Public Services Dashboard

Grama Darpan is a simple front-end web app I built to simulate a transparent and trackable public service system, like what you'd expect in a real-world government portal. It includes features like user login, registration, Aadhaar/PAN detail collection, service logging (via a mock blockchain), IoT-based supply tracking, and an admin panel.
